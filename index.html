      <h3>Hi!</h3>
     
      
      <p id="abttt">I am 12 years old and I study in 7th<br> grade. My favourite colors are rosegold and
         black.<br> I love writing short stories and blogs.<br> I also love to do coding when I'm free. <br>My
         favourite subject is English and my <br>favourite sport is badminton.
          I love to<br> help people. My favourite book is 'The Wizard Of<br> Oz', and my favourite hobby is<br> Writing Short 
          Stories/ Creative Writing.<br> I know three languages, English Hindi and French,<br> However, I don't know French 
          <br>that well. My favourite songs are probably <br> Lotus Inn and Fallin', both by Why Don't We.<br>
           I love to make people laugh.

      <h1 id="favtitle">Creative Writing/ Writing Short Stories</h1>
  
    
      <p id="writingpart1">Have you ever tried, or even wondered what it's like to write short stories? I have! And, I have to tell you, that it's actually more exciting than it seems to be! I feel like writing short stories is very interesting, because it has many genres- Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Historical Fiction, Mystery, Drama, Fiction, Horror, Non-fiction and many more! The genres which I mostly write in, are definetely gonna be Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Mystery and Fiction! I love creative writing, because I can pen down my thoughts and it also increases my vocabulary! You should also try starting with Daily Journaling, because it improves your expression and helps you express your emotions even better! </p>
      <p id="writingpart2">Can you guess which type of writing was this?... It's a written monologue! A monologue is a piece of writing in which there is only one speaker, who's telling the audience or anyone about something. A monologue can either be written or oral. A dialogue is a piece of writing in which there are two, or more people talking to each other. Now, can you guess the difference between class discussions and lectures? You're right! Class discussions is a type of dialogue, while lectures is a type of monologue! Okay, I'm not gonna make this long and I don't even want to make creative writing boring, so I'm just gonna stop writing now!! If you're planning on starting daily journaling, then, </p>
      <p id="writingconclusion">Happy Writing!!!</p>
